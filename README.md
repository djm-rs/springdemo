# springdemo
Boilerplate application for spring and spring security.

This boilerplate application is designed for people new to web development in Java, maven and spring. Idea is to provide them with the application that is all set up so they can get right to coding.

You can simply download this application to your computer, import it into you favorite IDE, build it and deploy it. It will run with basic functionality.

Application has spring, spring security and logging already setup. You are provided with main controller which you can remove, an index page, login page, logout page and several error pages.

It should be relatively simple to extend it fuurther.
